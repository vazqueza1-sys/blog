  <h1>Stop Giving Michelangelo a Q-Tip</h1>
  <p>You wouldn’t ask Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel with a Q-tip. Or send your fire department into a burning building with squirt guns.</p>
  <p>Absurd, right?</p>
  <p>And yet—that’s what a lot of workers are dealing with every single day. Outdated systems. Broken tools. Long-winded processes designed to work <em>around</em> the limitations of in-house technology.</p>
  <p>This isn’t about laziness or lack of talent. It’s about the reality on the ground—especially in local government.</p>
  <p>Your people want to do good work. But they’re stuck trying to meet modern expectations with tools that weren’t built for the job.</p>
  <p><strong>Let’s fix that.</strong></p>
